# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset representing 20 days of trading data from Optiver's automated trading system. The primary goal was to investigate the success rates of orders and identify the factors influencing these rates. By understanding these factors, we can provide actionable recommendations to enhance the overall success rate of trades. The analysis involved extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and the application of logistic regression to model the success rate of orders.


# Code and Scripts

The code used to perform the analysis and generate the plots is available in the accompanying Jupyter notebook. The notebook includes:

- Data cleaning and preparation steps.
- Statistical analysis and visualization.
- Logistic regression modelling.
